    <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp health, in humans, the extent of an individual’s continuing physical, emotional, mental, and social ability to cope with his or her environment.</p><br />
    <p align="justify"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This definition is just one of many that are possible. What constitutes “good” health in particular can vary widely. The rather fragile individual who stays “well” within the ordinary environment of his or her existence may succumb to a heart attack from heavy shovelling after a snowstorm; or a sea-level dweller may move to a new home in the mountains, where the atmosphere has a lower content of oxygen, and suffer from shortness of breath and anemia until his or her red blood cell count adjusts itself to the altitude. Thus, even by this definition, the conception of good health must involve some allowance for change in the environment.</p><br />
    <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bad health can be defined as the presence of disease, good health as its absence—particularly the absence of continuing disease, because the person afflicted with a sudden attack of seasickness, for example, may not be thought of as having lost good health as a result of such a mishap.</p><br />
    <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Actually, there is a wide variable area between health and disease. Only a few examples are necessary to illustrate the point: It is physiologically normal for an individual to have a high blood sugar content 15 to 20 minutes after eating a meal. If, however, the sugar content remains elevated two hours later, this condition is abnormal and may be indicative of disease.</font> </p>
